    <!--Div is a content division element. It is a special Html element that
        allows us to divide our content on our website so that we can structure
        each div seperately. Has a height of zero by default (WidthxHeight). In
        order for the Div to function we must use CSS.-->



    <!-- Block Elements:
          - Elements that take up the whole width on the page of the screen.
          - Common elements include: Paragraphs, Headers, Divs, lists, list
            items and forms. -->

    <!-- The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a apart of a
         text, or a part of a document. Ususally used with CSS. Unlike block
         elements, an inline element only takes up as much space as it needs to in
         the height and its width.

        Common inline elements:
          - Spans, images, and anchors (links usually show up next to each other).

    -->

    <!-- Display:
            - We can change BLOCK elements to inline elements using the Display
              tag. Since paragraphs are naturally block elements using the
              display element, we can make it inline placing all the elements
              on the same line.
            - One downside to inline elements, is that you are not able to change
              the width. HOW DO WE GET PAST THIS? Using the inline-block property
              with the display property. INLINE-BLOCK DEFINITION: Displays an
              element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is
              formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width
              values.

            -There are FOUR values that we will cover using the display tag:
             Block, Inline, inline-block, and None. None simply gets rid of our
             element.

        NONE VS VISIBILITY:
            -"None", completely makes it seem like that portion of the code was
              never there. Almost like they were deleted.
            -"Visibility", uses a property called "hidden" which makes the
              element not visible, but the space that it has occupied on the
              webpage is still there as if it were invisible.

          Position property
            -Static
              -All html elements are static in their position by default. Meaning
              go along with the html rules and going along with the html flow.

            -Relative
              -Allows us to position the element that we select relative to how
              it would've been positioned had it been static.
              - EX: img{
                        position: Relative
                        left (This is one of the four coordinate properties that
                        relative uses. The others are top, bottom, and right.
                        Think of this as adding a 30 px margin to the left,
                        giving the impression that the image is being moved to
                        the right.): 30px;
                            }

<!-- Lecture 48:
        Absolute Postioning
          -Positions the element relative to its parent. So unlike the
            relative position which moves our element the opposite direction,
            absolute move it in the direction you specify inside the parent.
            Essentially, you're adding a margin to its parent element vs
            the relative positioning which adds a margin relative to where the
            element should've been.
            Example: if you have the position: absolute, then right: 100px;
                      the element would move 100 px to the right.

          - When using absolute positioning, you're taking th element out of the
            flow of the document.

          - Below you will see a on overall parent div and other nested divs in
            an example code below. This will show you how this works more and
            how you can take advantage of creating your own parent rather than
            use the overall body to control your overall positioning.

        Fixed Positioning:

          Using fixed positioning allows our element to be position relative to
          the view port, meaning it will stay in the smae place even if the page is scrolled.
